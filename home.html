              <p class="text-left mt-5" style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(90,166,210)"> The food processor allows its users to quickly
                slice, chop and grind a variety of foods. The food goes into the main compartment which must be locked on
                to the base. The buttons are inactive until the two upper pieces are locked on correctly. Once all pieces
              are locked the blade can be activated and set to spin at different speeds. </p>
              <p class="text-right mt-3" style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold; "> I interviewed three users on their experience
              using the KitchenAid food processor. The following is a summary of my observations and users' responses, and an examination of the food processor UX through
                personas and story-boarding.</p>
